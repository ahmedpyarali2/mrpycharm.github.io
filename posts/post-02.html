								<p>I started learning python during my sophomore year at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, where I was enrolled in a four year computer science program. Before my exposure to python, I was able to write some basic code in C language. Believe me, pointers in C are a total nightmare. However, I admire C languge alot because of its low level access to a machine and ofcourse because it is considered God's language.</p>
								<p>The way I got into python scripting is very funny. Actually, I was writing a password breaker in Java during my summer's break. As soon as I started executing the code on NetBeans, it kept running and didn't stop. It was taking long to break a very simple password (atleast this is what I was assuming). I started searching on the internet for a "faster" language than Java. Although I couldn't find any "magical" language of this kind but, I got to know about python as a "hacker's language" and the next minute, I was totally in love with this neat and clean language. I replicated the same code I wrote in Java, in Python and Woah! It took just 2 seconds to break a password... WAIT.. WHAT?? JUST 2 SECS?</p>
								<p>Fast forward 2 years into my python journey, I realized I was missing a break statment in my password breaker code that I wrote in Java :D But.. it was too late for me to realize this. I had already fallen in love with this sweet and simple language and now there was no going back. On a serious note, I really love the way python allows you to program something. It is clean, clear and to the point. When you read a python snippet, it feels like you are reading a psuedocode. And that is where python stands out against other languages. It allows researchers and scientific community to quickly replicate their research and test out things. Hence, the reason python is the most popular language among researchers.</p>
								<p>I will have to admit here, that Python is by nature a slow language. That's because it is an interpreted language, not a compiled language like Java. But, that didn't stop it from becoming a swaggy, popular kid at a high school. It is amazing to see, how this language have gained popularity among various platforms. Let it be web development, desktop devlopment or even android development (kiwy is the module's name) this language have turned out to be a language that provides the fastest way of prototyping things and without writing a messy code.</p>
								<p>Now I use python daily at work, writing REST API's using different web frameworks like Flask, Tornado e.t.c. It feels like, my purpose of life has been  fulfilled and now I can pass out in peace (ofcourse when the time comes).</p>
